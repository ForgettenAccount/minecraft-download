# Non-Experimental Features and Bug Fixes

#### Create New World

The *Create New World*screen has been given a new design that is now available for some players. We would love to hear your feedback on it in [this post](http://aka.ms/MCCreateNewWorldUI)!

## Vanilla Parity

Worlds can now be created with 64-bit seeds (-9223372036854775808 to 9223372036854775807) and those can be copied between Bedrock and Java to produce the same world ([MCPE-144994](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MCPE-144994)) ([MCPE-148168](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MCPE-148168))

Non-numeric seed UI inputs now produce the same seeds as Java Edition

Player's arm no longer twitches while charging a bow ([MCPE-148486](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MCPE-148486))

Falling blocks have full-block hitbox again

Fixed an error where Journeymen Clerics would offer Glowstone Dust instead of Glowstone Blocks ([MCPE-57524](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MCPE-57524))

Untamed Wolves can now be leashed ([MCPE-82050](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MCPE-82050))

## Blocks

TNT blocks now correctly move in a random X/Z direction once lit

Fixed an issue with resource drops occasionally remaining black after breaking and placing a block quickly in its place

Top Snow no longer clips with the block beneath when falling

## Commands

Added the "hasitem" filter for target selector of entities. This allows the player to target entities based on the items that have in their inventory or are wearing

## Gameplay

Fixed Fangs from the Illager spells not being spawnable in blocks with no bounding boxes

Water and Lava Buckets can now be used on underwater blocks cohabitating with water, such as Light Blocks or Big Dripleaves ([MCPE-148392](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MCPE-148392))

Players in Visitor Mode can no longer break Paintings and Minecarts ([MCPE-132869](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MCPE-132869))

Teleporting vertically beyond the visibility distance now loads the terrain correctly ([MCPE-150021](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MCPE-150021))

Improved accuracy of damage calculations

Fixed an issue where interacting with the Bell while holding a chargeable item would not continuously ring it ([MCPE-56968](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MCPE-56968))

Fixed a bug where the player could switch to gliding when riding in certain scenarios ([MCPE-147904](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MCPE-147904))
